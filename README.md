# college_basketball_predictions
This is the source code for the project posted on my [blog post](https://rberger997.github.io/2019-02-11-college_basketball/). The goal was to predict winners of every college basketball game using machine learning.

The `src` folder contains all scripts used to scrape and clean the data, the different models tested, and update with new predictions for the given day.
